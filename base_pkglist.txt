; Here is a list of Arch Linux packages which need to be recompiled with SELinux support.
; "core/foo = 1.4.2-1" means that:
;  * "foo" is a base package from "core", which is replaced by "foo-selinux"
;  * "foo-selinux/PKGBUILD" is in sync with "foo" version 1.4.2-1
; the version is optional. Not having it means that the -selinux package uses
; the same pkgrel as the base package.
